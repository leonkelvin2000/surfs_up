## Overview of the statistical analysis
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data from the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice scream shop business is sustainable year-round. We decided to use two months as an example to determine how stable the weather will be. 
 
## Results

The average temperature in June is almost 4 degreaes higher than December.

The minimum temperature in December drops to 56 degrees, which is pretty cold to be in the water, while June's minimum is 64 degrees.

75% of the time, the temperature is at 77 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in June and 74 degrees Fahenheit or higher in December.

Its interesting that the max temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than max temperature in December... maybe those are anomalies or normal to get some very warm days in December along with some that are not quite so warm.

## Summary

Recommendation Based on Temperature Analysis

Provided that 69 degrees Fahrenheit is considered warm enough for surfers to get out into the water even in December we would expect surfers to get out and be at the shop at least 75% of the days and June that % is higher. Given the overall temperature statistics at two very different times in the year, I believe its fair to say that Oahu would be a good place for aa surf shop. It would also be important to have an understanding of how temperature affects ice-cream sales, to help A. Wavy understand the potential with the ice-cream opporunity as well as the surfs shop revenue.

Weather Metrics to Analyze - Level of Precipitation

It might also be a good idea to take a look at not only the temperatures in June and December, but also the precipitation levels and the statistics in each month around that measure. It might help us understand how many good surfing days we should expect in each of these months. While adding in precipitation, we may want to plot on a chart the temperatures vs. precipitation to see if there are any correlations.

Weather Metrics to Gather and Analyze - Wind Speed

While wind speed is not something we currently have available, it would be worth getting some of that data to be able to analyze the metric for June and December. Wind speed would give us an idea of the quality of the surfing conditions, which is likely related to the number of surfers that would be out on a given day. We may also want to consider comparing to other metrics we have analyzed to see if there are correlations that could help us ensure we are putting this business in the right location.
